				<h3>There are a selection of cleanses we offer, however, let us talk briefly about cleansing, its purpose and what it can do for you:</h3>
				<p class="noPadOrMargin">
					Most of us think about hygiene as taking a shower, brushing our teeth, combing our hair, 
					even vacuuming the rug, doing the dishes, washing our car; however, do we ever think 
					about keeping things running efficient on the inside? Just like a well lubed car, if you 
					don’t drain the dirty oil and put in fresh clean oil the cars engine cannot run efficiently 
					and will lock up; our bodies will do the same over time. Our body is like a furnace that 
					needs good fuel to burn. If garbage is put in for a period of time, it no longer runs at 
					optimum levels and instead is bogged down and sick and tired. As we put in our bodies 
					fats, carcinogens, anti-biotics, preservatives, additives, substances that turn into toxic 
					waste, the body has to store it somewhere and that is in fat pockets that can eventually 
					become cysts, boils, and tumors. Detoxing the body through a cleanse can purge toxic 
					waste from your liver, colon and down to the cellular level freeing up the body from the 
					waste it was swimming in to now gain energy, loose weight, eliminate bowels properly 
					and feel GREAT.
